How to Set Up Multiple Wordpress Installs Locally

s. and look at this:
https://wpmudev.com/blog/setting-up-xampp/?utm_expid=3606929-94.Ie3dH-CaRwe6MU3VrZsdvw.0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F
something about setting up multisite by typing it in. I think that might be something else though.


guide on wp dve.
https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/sett...
get xampp.
wordpress.

check if working localhost if see xampp... then working.
lamp stack install wordpress.

in xampp, dev, htdocs.
could have subfolder or different sites there.
he likes a short url so in htdoce. s. then could put in 
themes. But donâ€™t.
new folder, name, install wordpress to that folder.
copy it to there.
he has installed to htdocs\name 
and wordpress folders are there.
go to wpconfig-sample, change to just wpconfig.
open it.

enter new db name, db user and db password there.
in the thing parts there.


there is also a wpconfig sample file.

go into xammp and admin for db and start configuring it.

create new db, same name as the folder. put db infront of name maybe.
add new use, don't need to make tables now.
generate password.
copy them into the wpconfig.
go to localhost\name
if errors then check matches php admin.
if proper get to wordpress form,
create name, new user, now new wp website.
now make another.
name2 in the same xamp\htdocs folder.
click install wordpress.

s. i wonder if can just make themes. maybe not.
copy wordpress there, same,
make new db go to localhost admin or from wp site.
make new usernames, priveleges add user account user name2
generate password, rename wpconfig sample in that folder to
wpconfig. open it, copy the details from the myadmin program,
save.

make sure press create new user. check it's added.
go to localhost/name2, see wordpress form, make name,
same as previous, click install wordpress.

now you can go to different sites and they are both there.
to check you can change the them of one to show it's different.
they have differetn databases, can access dbs in myadmin.
now can change things in each folder to program.

s. how to switch between  each project. So far, just open the different websites. 
I think there should be a login unless you are logged into both.
You might have to log out of each db using xampp.
