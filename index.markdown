<h3>My Bachelors Degree in Physics</h3>
I am going to complete my Bachelor's Degree in Physics at the Open University in September this year. My last module is a project in which I have chosen to write a review on the topic of quantum metrology with entangled squeezed photons.

<h3>My Extra-curricula Study</h3>

In my free time I am learning python. Once I have learned python, I intend to study web development, perhaps at masters degree level.

<h3>My Github</h3>


I started a Github page in April and here is the url: [Github Steven-14](https://github.com/steven-14).

So far I have uploaded files related to the python for everybody course, some files for a Freecodecamp web development course, and a few other beginner python projects.
