<h3>My Bachelors Degree in Physics</h3>
I completed my Bachelor's Degree with honours in Natural Science (Physics) at the Open University. My last module was a project in which I chose to write a review on the topic of quantum metrology with entangled squeezed photons.

<h3>My Github</h3>


I started a Github page in April and here is the url: [Github Steven-14](https://github.com/steven-14).

So far I have uploaded files related to the python for everybody course, some files for a Freecodecamp web development course, and a few other beginner python projects.
